# Overview

Essence Bound was a semester-long narrative-focused conceptual RPG I made in my narrative design class. The story is based on a society of magical and non-magical beings who begin to get extremely violent in an effort to obtain more magic. 

# Design Process

This project was easily one of my favorites because it gave me so much room to dive deep into writing and world-building—two things I genuinely love. We started off with pitching our initial concept, and from there, the entire RPG slowly came to life, piece by piece.

I drew a lot of inspiration for my characters from novels, particularly because I admire how authors create characters with such complexity and emotional depth. Capturing even a fraction of that depth is something I'm always aiming for, and it's something I want to push further in future projects.

Getting the chance to craft detailed dialogue scenes was especially rewarding. It let me step directly into my characters' heads and think about how they'd really speak and act in their world. Exploring all the layers of world-building—everything from lore and cultures to how societies interact—was another highlight that made this project stand out to me. It reminded me exactly why RPG design is so exciting and creatively fulfilling.

# Challenges

**Branching Stories:**
I am a huge fan of branching storylines in video games. But when it ultimately came down to making a branching storyline for a video game myself, it was a challenge. Some of the first feedback I received from my professor when I wrote out the entire storyline was that it would make a great film or book but not a choice-based RPG with a branching narrative. While that might've been a bit hard to hear at the time, it was true and forced me to reexamine the commonalities and differences between different forms of storytelling.
