**Genre:** 3D RPG

**Engine:** Unreal

**Timeframe:** In-Progress

## Overview

Divine Ruin started out as a completely different game. Originally, I pitched it as a 2D platformer that was story-driven but included a lot of action and combat. My professor liked my pitch and told me to go for a prototype. However, after talking more about the project and looking at my writing, my professor suggested I do a top-down RPG that was focused on dialogue and story instead. 
Divine Ruin is still a work in progress and not a finished prototype, but I’ve made significant steps to ensure that the prototype is done this semester.

## Challenges

**Pivoting from a 2D Platformer to a 3D Top-Down RPG**
The biggest challenge I’ve faced so far with Divine Ruin is feeling stuck after I pivoted it from a 2D platformer to a 3D top-down RPG. I was excited by the idea of a game that was similar to games I love, like Disco Elysium, and also very dialogue-heavy, but I also felt that I didn’t know where to take it. I felt lost with its direction for a little while, but with more research into games, I wanted it to look like, I was able to determine where it was going. Going into Unreal also helped me determine what I wanted the game to look like.
