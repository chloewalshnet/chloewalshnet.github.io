# Overview

Mutant Malfunction was a week long game jam team project, a tower defense game developed in Unity where players defend a research lab from waves of mutated creatures. I collaborated with a small team, contributing systems implementation, UI design, and narrative framing.

# My Contributions

### Opening Cutscene & Narrative Setup

I implemented the game's opening cutscene and wrote the initial dialogue, expanding on a world concept proposed by teammates. My goal was to establish narrative tone and setting quickly, giving players context for the gameplay and giving the team a clear foundation for visual and audio design.

### UI Implementation & Tooltip Systems

I scripted interactive UI elements including:

* Tooltip systems for towers, allowing players to see descriptions/stats
* Volume control and main menu functionality
* A functional pause menu with adjustable settings

This work helped improve player clarity, especially during early waves, and allowed for quick tuning during playtesting.

### Tower Balancing

I handled numerical balance for the tower economy, tuning:

* Tower damage and range to differentiate roles
* Upgrade and purchase costs to maintain difficulty pacing
* Enemy health scaling in relation to player power curve

I used feedback from team playtests to adjust values, ensuring no dominant strategy emerged and that weaker towers still had niche use.

# Challenges

Working across multiple time zones made coordination difficult at times, but I collaborated closely with our project lead and other designers to maintain clarity and meet our scope goals within the week. Quick iteration and feedback cycles helped the team stay aligned.
