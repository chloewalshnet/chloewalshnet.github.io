## Overview

A tower defense game that I made with a small team in a week. 


## My Contributions
**Beginning Dialogue and Backstory**

I wrote the beginning dialogue and expanded upon the backstory that had been brainstormed by some of my other teammates. This gave a good basis for the rest of the team concerning where our game was taking place. I also programmed and implemented the cut scene that opens the game.

**UI Elements and Volume Control**
I programmed some of the UI elements, including the tooltips, so that the towers all have descriptions attached to them. I also designed and programmed the menus and volume control.

**Tower Balancing**
I adjusted the prices and damage of each of the towers so that they were more balanced to the enemies. 

## Challenges
Communicating over multiple time zones was a significant development challenge, but the team was able to make up for it with our great lead, who worked hard to keep communication between everyone clear.
