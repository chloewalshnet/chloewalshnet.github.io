excerpt: "Hello! I’m Chloe Walsh, a systems-driven designer with a background in computer engineering and a foundation in VR simulation. My work bridges the gap between game design and applied simulation: designing mechanics, interfaces, and logic systems that support interaction, learning, and storytelling. Whether building branching narratives or prototyping training scenarios, I’m drawn to systems that shape how people think and act."

Hey there! I'm Chloe, a passionate game designer with a love for storytelling, immersive worlds, and crafting engaging gameplay experiences. My creative heart beats strongest in the realm of RPGs, where narrative depth meets player-driven choices.

I specialize in designing intuitive gameplay systems, captivating narratives, and engaging quests that invite players into unforgettable adventures. My skills include:

- Game Design: Systems design, narrative design, puzzle creation, and quest design.
- Technical Skills: Unity, Unreal Engine, Unreal Blueprints, scripting in C#, C++.
- Creative Writing: Worldbuilding, character development, dialogue writing, and branching narratives.
- Collaboration: Effective teamwork, clear communication, and iterative design approaches.

Games that inspire and shape my approach to design:

- Divinity: Original Sin 2 – for its intricate storytelling, deep character interactions, and rich tactical combat.
- Disco Elysium – for redefining narrative-driven games with profound philosophical themes and unparalleled dialogue systems.
- Fable 2 – for its whimsical charm, meaningful player choices, and engaging storytelling.
- The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – for its expansive open world, impactful storytelling, and compelling side quests.
- The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – for its unparalleled exploration, immersive world, and endless player freedom.
- Baldur's Gate 3 – for its outstanding narrative depth, reactive world-building, and dynamic combat systems.

When I'm not diving into game development, you might find me exploring new vegetarian recipes, hanging out with my pets, or planning my next creative adventure. I'm also an avid reader of fantasy and science fiction novels, watching captivating films, and, of course, playing video games.
