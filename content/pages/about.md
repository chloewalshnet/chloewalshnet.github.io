excerpt: "Hello! I’m Chloe Walsh, a systems-driven designer with a background in computer engineering and a foundation in VR simulation. My work bridges the gap between game design and applied simulation: designing mechanics, interfaces, and logic systems that support interaction, learning, and storytelling. Whether building branching narratives or prototyping training scenarios, I’m drawn to systems that shape how people think and act."

I’m Chloe Walsh, a systems-focused designer with a background in computer engineering and early experience in VR simulation. I started in Unity building photogrammetry-based virtual experiences under the guidance of a mentor, contributing to museum-style exhibits that emphasized realism and interactivity. From there, I studied engineering before ultimately focusing on game design, where I found the perfect intersection of simulation and storytelling. I now design systems that model logic, interaction, and consequence across both entertainment and applied use cases.

I specialize in systems design across games and simulations, with experience building branching dialogue systems, turn-based combat, and logic-based interactions in both Unity and Unreal.

### Core Skills

**Systems and Simulation Design:** Gameplay mechanics, logic systems, branching dialogue, turn-based systems, training scenario design, simulation workflows

**Programming and Scripting:** C++, C#, Python, Unreal Blueprints, Unity scripting, Arduino

**Technical and Engineering Tools:** MATLAB, LabVIEW, Visual Studio, sensor integration, data flow logic

**Engines and Platforms:** Unity, Unreal Engine, VR simulation, photogrammetry tools and workflow

**Version Control:** Git, Perforce

**Visual and 3D Tools:** Blender, Maya, ZBrush, Photoshop

**Narrative and Design Thinking:** Narrative systems, character dialogue, worldbuilding, consequence-driven storytelling

**Collaboration and Process:** Rapid prototyping, documentation for technical and design teams, agile iteration, cross-discipline communication

### Games that influence my design approach

**Disco Elysium:** for its raw psychological depth, fearless philosophical lens, and total reinvention of what narrative systems can be. There’s nothing else quite like it.

**Fable 2:** for making the world feel truly reactive, where choices about relationships, morality, and property shaped the game around you in personal, systemic ways.

**Skyrim:** for its immersive worldbuilding and freedom to explore; a game where the side quests, factions, and personal choices often eclipse the main story, pulling players into hundreds of hours of emergent adventure.

**Baldur’s Gate 3:** for giving weight to every choice, blending narrative and mechanics so player decisions feel both strategic and emotionally meaningful.

When I’m not building systems or designing mechanics, I’m probably baking, walking my dog, playing games, or reading fantasy and science fiction novels that are just a little too long. I’m especially interested in projects that explore strategy, consequence, and interactive learning, whether in games or applied simulation.
