excerpt: Hi! I’m Chloe Walsh, a soon-to-be game design graduate with a passion for crafting immersive worlds and engaging gameplay experiences. As a storyteller and designer, I’m fascinated by games that let you explore stories at your own pace—where your choices truly matter. That’s what inspires my approach to design. I thrive on creating memorable adventures by blending systems, narrative, and player-driven mechanics. Whether it’s designing turn-based combat, writing branching quests, or experimenting with character progression systems, I’m constantly thinking about how players will engage with the world I’ve built.
