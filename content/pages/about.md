excerpt: Hi! I’m Chloe Walsh, a soon-to-be game design graduate with a passion for crafting immersive worlds and engaging gameplay experiences. As a storyteller and designer, I’m fascinated by games that let you explore stories at your own pace—where your choices truly matter. That’s what inspires my approach to design. I thrive on creating memorable adventures by blending systems, narrative, and player-driven mechanics. Whether it’s designing turn-based combat, writing branching quests, or experimenting with character progression systems, I’m constantly thinking about how players will engage with the world I’ve built.

Hey there! I'm Chloe, a passionate game designer with a love for storytelling, immersive worlds, and crafting engaging gameplay experiences. My creative heart beats strongest in the realm of RPGs, where narrative depth meets player-driven choices.

I specialize in designing intuitive gameplay systems, captivating narratives, and engaging quests that invite players into unforgettable adventures. My skills include:

- Game Design: Systems design, narrative design, puzzle creation, and quest design.

- Technical Skills: Unity, Unreal Engine, Unreal Blueprints, scripting in C#, C++.

- Creative Writing: Worldbuilding, character development, dialogue writing, and branching narratives.

- Collaboration: Effective teamwork, clear communication, and iterative design approaches.

Games that inspire and shape my approach to design:

- Divinity: Original Sin 2 – for its intricate storytelling, deep character interactions, and rich tactical combat.

- Disco Elysium – for redefining narrative-driven games with profound philosophical themes and unparalleled dialogue systems.

- Fable 2 – for its whimsical charm, meaningful player choices, and engaging storytelling.

- The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – for its expansive open world, impactful storytelling, and compelling side quests.

- The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – for its unparalleled exploration, immersive world, and endless player freedom.

- Baldur's Gate 3 – for its outstanding narrative depth, reactive world-building, and dynamic combat systems.

When I'm not diving into game development, you might find me exploring new vegetarian recipes, hanging out with my pets, or planning my next creative adventure. I'm also an avid reader of fantasy and science fiction novels, watching captivating films, and, of course, playing video games.
